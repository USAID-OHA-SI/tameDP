\title{Import PSNUxIM data from Data Pack and Clean}
\usage{
tame_dp(filepath, map_names = TRUE, psnu_lvl = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{file path to the Data Pack importing, must be .xlsx}

\item{map_names}{import names from DATIM (OU, mechanism, partner) associated with mech_code}

\item{psnu_lvl}{aggregate to the PSNU level instead of IM}
}
\description{
tame_dp is the primary function of the tameDP package, reading in the Data
Pack and munging in into a tidy data frame to make it more usable to
interact with the data than the way it is stored in the Data Pack. **Given
the changes to the Data Pack each year, the function only works for the
current COP year, COP21.**
}
\details{
The main function of `tameDP` is to bring import a COP20 Data Pack into R
and make it tidy. The function aggregates the COP targets up to the
mechanism level, imports the mechanism information from DATIM, and breaks
out the data elements to make the dataset more usable.

  - Imports Data Pack as tidy data frame
  - Breaks up data elements stored in the indicatorCode column into distinct columns
  - Cleans up the HTS variables, separating modalities out of the indicator name
  - Creates a statushiv column
  - Cleans and separates PSNU and PSNU UID into distinct columns
  - Adds in mechanism information from DATIM, including operatingunit, funding agency, partner and mechanism name
  - Removes any rows with no targets
  - Allows for aggregate to the PSNU level
